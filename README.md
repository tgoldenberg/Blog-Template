### A mobile-first-designed blog template using [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/)
*** 
### Gems used 
  + `bourbon`
  + `neat`
  + `simple_form`
  + `haml-rails`
  + `redcarpet`
  + `simple_form`

***
### Description
- My first experience designing a website from a mobile-first perspective, focusing on responsive design. Also, a chance to become more familiar with the `haml-rails` gem and __Thoughtbot's__ `Bourbon` CSS library.

*** 
### Takeaways from the experience 

+ Definitely it isn't necessary to always depend on __Bootstrap__. I was able to achieve all the things I would normally use `Bootstrap` for with the __Bourbon__ library, and it is much more lightweight.
+ Designing for mobile is hard at first, but rewarding at the end. If the site works perfectly well on mobile, it is much easier to tweak it to work on desktops than the other way around. I found that I had to modify two or three CSS elements for the desktop screen. 
+ Using the __redcarpet__ gem was also an interesting way to include __markup__ html in the __haml__ files. This, combined with the `haml-rails` gem, made the html writing a much more enjoyable experience.
